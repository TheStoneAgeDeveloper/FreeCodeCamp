<b><h1>Convert Celsius To Fahrenheit</h1></b>
<br/>
To test your learning, you will create a solution "from scratch". Place your code between the indicated lines and it will be tested against multiple test cases.

The algorithm to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit is the temperature in Celsius times 9/5, plus 32.

You are given a variable celsius representing a temperature in Celsius. Use the variable fahrenheit already defined and apply the algorithm to assign it the corresponding temperature in Fahrenheit.

Note
Don't worry too much about the function and return statements as they will be covered in future challenges. For now, only use operators that you have already learned.

<b><h1>Word Blanks</h1></b>
<br/>
In this challenge, we provide you with a noun, a verb, an adjective and an adverb. You need to form a complete sentence using words of your choice, along with the words we provide.

You will need to use the string concatenation operator + to build a new string, using the provided variables: myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, and myAdverb. You will then assign the formed string to the result variable.

You will also need to account for spaces in your string, so that the final sentence has spaces between all the words. The result should be a complete sentence.
<br/>
<b><h1>Shopping List</h1></b>
<br/>
Create a shopping list in the variable myList. The list should be a multi-dimensional array containing several sub-arrays.

The first element in each sub-array should contain a string with the name of the item. The second element should be a number representing the quantity i.e.There should be at least 5 sub-arrays in the list.
